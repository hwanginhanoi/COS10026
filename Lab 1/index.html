        <hr />

        <p>
            Hello, I'm Hwang. I'm a freshman at Swinburne University of
            Technology, majoring in Computer Science. Currently I'm playing with
            <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby(Rails)</a> and
            <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Python(Django)</a>
        </p>

        <p>Hanoi is where I'm living in. Proud to be Hanoian, ehehe.</p>

        <p>
            I like being alone, yes, <strong>ALONE</strong>. Makes me
            comfortable.
        </p>

        <p>
            I made this website as a part of my lab work for my course at
            university, but it's not the sole reason. I also want to share a
            little bit about my personality, my dreams, my interests to
            everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
            I just getting used to HTML and CSS, so feel free to point me out if
            there's anything wrong.
        </p>

        <p>Hope this site will help you some way, somehow. Idk...</p>
